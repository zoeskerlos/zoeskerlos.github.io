          <h2>Australia Introduction</h2>

            <p>Aboriginal Australians arrived on the continent at least 60,000 years ago and developed complex hunter-gatherer societies and oral histories. Dutch navigators led by Abel TASMAN were the first Europeans to land in Australia in <time datetime="1606">1606</time>, and they mapped the western and northern coasts.</p>
            <p> They named the continent New Holland but made no attempts to permanently settle it. In <time datetime="1770"> 1770 </time>, English captain James COOK sailed to the east coast of Australia, named it New South Wales, and claimed it for Great Britain. In<time datetime="1788">1788</time>and <time datetime="1825">1825</time>, Great Britain established New South Wales and then Tasmania as penal colonies respectively.</p>
            <p> Great Britain and Ireland sent more than 150,000 convicts to Australia before ending the practice in<time datetime="1868">1868</time>. As Europeans began settling areas away from the coasts, they came into more direct contact with Aboriginal Australians. Europeans also cleared land for agriculture, impacting Aboriginal Australiansâ€™ ways of life.</p>
            <p>These issues, along with disease and a policy in the<time datetime="1900s">1900s</time> that forcefully removed Aboriginal children from their parents, reduced the Aboriginal Australian population from more than 700,000 pre-European contact to a low of 74,000 in <time datetime="1933">1933</time>. </p>
            <p>Four additional colonies were established in Australia in the mid-1800s: Western Australia<time datetime="1829">(1829)</time>, South Australia<time datetime="1836">(1836)</time>, Victoria<time datetime="1851">(1851)</time>, and Queensland<time datetime="1859">(1859)</time>. Gold rushes beginning in the <time datetime="1850">1850s</time> brought thousands of new immigrants to New South Wales and Victoria, helping to reorient Australia away from its penal colony roots.</p>
